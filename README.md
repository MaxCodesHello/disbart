# disbart
A basic little discord bot.

DISCLAIMER: the code is messy, there's a lot of crap in it. This is because i've had a lot of people help me with this bot and some of them added uselessness, like else statement for example. I'm too lazy to fix this, unless there's a serious issue in which case lmk.

So back in late 2020 i made a bot called disbart. It was a pretty basic bot, but i had like 7 people using it and that was alright for me. I've since discontinued it, but i have a new version (disbart 2.0) which you can find on my [botlist](https://botcheck.fupl.ml). 

Anyway, i've decided to post the code here, so you can use it. I'm too lazy to set up a license, so as long as you don't delete the credits command (you can edit it in any way you want as long as it's giving credit to me) i'm ok with it. 

Happy coding!
